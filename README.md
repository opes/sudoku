# Sudoku Solver by ChatGPT

This is an example of a Sudoku solver implementation written by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) using JavaScript.

Minimal modifications were made to the output — namely updating the syntax to ES6 using `let`/`const`, as well as updating the equality operators from `==` to `===`. The input was also generated by ChatGPT.

I basically did nothing other than ask the thing some questions.
